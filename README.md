## What is Appzuku?
Appzuku is an Android application that stops background applications using either Shizuku or Root permissions. It helps improve device performance, reduce memory usage, and lower device heat in a lightweight and safe way.

## Features
- **Flexible Permissions**: Works with either Shizuku or Root access.
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find apps in your running list by name or package ID.
- **Autostart Prevention**: Prevent specific apps from running in the background automatically.
- **Theme Customization**: Support for Light, Dark, and System Default themes.
- **Background Service**: Automatically kills unused apps periodically when activated.
- **Quick Settings Tile**: Toggle the background service directly from your notification shade.
- **Protected Apps**: System-critical apps and user-whitelisted apps are protected from being killed.
- **RAM Monitoring**: Real-time display of system RAM usage.
